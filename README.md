# Policy-Bazzar-Banking-Fraud

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Paisabazaar Banking Fraud Analysis** project focuses on identifying and analyzing fraudulent banking activities using real-world financial data. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, detect anomalies, and gain actionable insights that can help financial institutions reduce fraud risk and improve decision-making.

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature analysis, and visualization to understand fraud behavior in banking transactions.
